## My Process


### Built With 

- HTML 
- CSS
- Bootstrap 5.1.3
### What I Learned 

I learned how to hide images using `display: none`. Using the 
display value helped me hide one of the two hero images based on 
their screen size.  
### Continued Development 

I plan on continuing to broaden my understanding of how form validation works
using bootstrap. 


### Useful Resources 

- [Bootstrap Form Validation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/forms/validation/) - Learned about validating forms with bootstrap.  
- ["Required" attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_required.asp) - Used this attribute to specify that users fill out the email field before submitting the form.
